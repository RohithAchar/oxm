## Database Schema Utilization

The system leverages the following database tables:

3. **Pagination**: Implements proper pagination to limit data transfer
4. **Parallel Data Fetching**: Fetches related data in parallel
5. **Caching**: URL-based state management for better caching

## URL Structure

The system uses URL parameters to maintain filter state:
```
/products?search=keyword&category=electronics&price_min=100&price_max=500&verified=true&tags=premium,eco-friendly&sort=price_asc&page=1
```
